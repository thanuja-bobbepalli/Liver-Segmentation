# Liver-Segmentation

## Overview
This project focuses on liver segmentation from CT images using a deep learning-based U-Net model. The goal is to accurately segment the liver region from medical imaging scans.

## Dataset
- *Source*: [3d_liver-segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prathamgrover/3d-liver-segmentation)
- *Modality*: CT Scans
- *Annotations*: Liver masks for segmentation

## Methodology
1. *Preprocessing*
   - Resizing images for compatibility with the U-Net model
   - Normalization of pixel values
2. *Model Architecture*
   - U-Net (self-defined architecture)
3. *Training*
   - Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)
   - Optimizer: Adam
   - Metrics:
          - Dice Coefficient
          - mIoU
          - Precision
          - Recall
4. *Inference*
   - Model tested on unseen images
   - Segmented liver regions visualized


- *Visualization*
  - Example segmented outputs compared with ground truth masks

## Future Improvements
- Experiment with different loss functions such as Dice Loss
- Implement post-processing techniques to refine segmentation
- Explore ensembling with other architectures (e.g., DeepLabV3+)
